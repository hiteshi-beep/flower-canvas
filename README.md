# Interactive Flower Canvas

Interactive Flower Canvas is a creative web-based visual project that generates dynamic, animated flower patterns on user interaction. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project focuses on real-time rendering, procedural visuals, and smooth user-driven animations.

The canvas responds to mouse clicks and interactions to create evolving floral patterns, combining creativity with core web graphics concepts.

## Overview

This project uses the HTML `<canvas>` element and JavaScript animation techniques to render interactive flower-like visuals in real time. User input dynamically affects the position and appearance of the generated patterns, creating a visually engaging experience.

The goal of the project is to explore procedural graphics, animation loops, and interactive rendering directly in the browser without external libraries.

## Features

- Interactive flower generation on user input  
- Real-time canvas-based rendering  
- Smooth animations and visual transitions  
- Lightweight implementation using vanilla JavaScript  
- Fully browser-based, no backend required  

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- HTML Canvas API

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a simple front-end application.  
HTML defines the canvas and layout, CSS handles basic styling, and JavaScript manages rendering logic, animation loops, and user interaction handling.

---

## Usage

Open the live demo link in a modern web browser.  
Click anywhere on the canvas to generate flower patterns.  
Multiple interactions create layered and evolving visuals.
